Hack Oregon Back End
=================

Endpoints
----------------------------------------------

Hack Oregon serves a collection of endpoints from an AWS instance using a combination of Postgresql and OpenResty.

For documentation on each of these endpoints and their usage, please see https://github.com/hackoregon/backend/blob/master/endpoint_readme.md

To request additional endpoints, if you have access to the google docs spreadsheet, 'Hackoregon punch list to deployment', please describe the endpoint requirements there. If you do not yet have access to that spreadsheet, please create a git hub issue here: https://github.com/hackoregon/backend/issues

To request access to the google docs spreadsheet, please send an email to sam at hackoregon dot org  .
